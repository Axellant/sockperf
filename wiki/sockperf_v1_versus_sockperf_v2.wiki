#summary sockperf_v2 also supports TCP.

= Introduction =

sockperf_v1 is based on Voltaire's udp_lat and only supports UDP traffic (both UC and MC).

sockperf_v2 adds TCP support (and some complexity in the code)


= Details =

sockperf_v1 is based on udp_lat and adds to it:
 * latency under load mode
 * playback mode
 * discrete measurements at packet level (based on RDTSC) that allows providing better statistics.
 * additional switches and new options
 * major design changes for making the code easier for maintenance, while still keeping good performance and even improving it a bit.

sockperf_v2 is based on sockperf_v1 and adds to it TCP support.  it introduces more complexity in the code, but still provide the good performance.

In addition, sockperf_v1 was developed internally in Voltaire (acquired by Mellanox).  While sockperf_v2 was mainly developed by 3rd party contractor.
Both versions are maintained by Mellanox.
