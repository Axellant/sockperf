= Details =

sockperf is based on udp_lat that was developed by the VMA team at Voltaire.  
udp_lat is able to measure *average* latency of *ping-pong* test for UDP traffic.

 * sockperf_v1 (adds *latency-under-load* and *playback* modes, adds *discrete measuring of times at packet level* using RDTSC and prints histogram with percentiles for *spike analysis*, and uses *entire re-architecture of the code* using C++ templates for keeping high performance with readable and maintainable code) was developed by Avner BenHanoch, based on udp_lat.

 * sockperf_v2 (*TCP support*) was mainly developed by Igor Ivanov and others, based on sockperf_v1.
