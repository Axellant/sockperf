  * *C++ Templates* - for static binding of "virtual" functions (also available for inlining, unlike virtual functions).

  * *RDTSC* - for high-resolution, low-overhead way of getting timing information (applies for modern systems with "Invariant TSC")

  * *minimal overhead in the fast path* - in the fast path we only take txTime & rxTime of packets.  All calculations and statistics are performed after the fast path.  All memory allocations and other preparations are performed before the fast path

  * *inline the entire fast path* turn on -Winline and analyze any place the optimizer decided to avoid inlining a function call in the fast path.  Then improving the code so the optimizer will agree to inline it without compromising its good preferences.

  * *error handling is not inlined* replace blocks of error handling code with function call to error function.  This leaves more place for inlining real code of the fast path.

  * *and many more...*
