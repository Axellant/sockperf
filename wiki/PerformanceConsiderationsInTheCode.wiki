  * *C++ Templates* - for static binding of "virtual" functions
  * *RDTSC* - for high-resolution, low-overhead way of getting timing information (applies for modern systems with "Invariant TSC")
  * *minimal overhead in the fast path* - in the fast path we only take txTime & rxTime of packets.  All calculations and statistics are performed after the fast path.  All memory allocations and other preparations are performed before the fast path
